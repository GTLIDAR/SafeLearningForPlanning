# SafeLearningForPlanning
Code for the paper "Safe Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Planning via Interval MDP Abstraction"

# To Run:
The code can be run interactively via the Jupyter notebook Paper_Case_Study_SGP.ipynb or using the python script Paper_Case_Study_SGP.py, which both produce the results and figures shown in the paper.
In either case, the image safe_grid_casestudy_final.png is necessary to reproduce the paper figures.
